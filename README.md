# Video Game Classifier

Welcome to the Video Game Classifier! This is a Python-based machine learning project that classifies video games based on various features. The project utilizes pandas, numpy, Altair, and scikit-learn to preprocess data, build models, and visualize results.

# Features

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare video game datasets for analysis.

# Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features for classification.

Classification Models: Train and evaluate models using scikit-learn.

Visualization: Use Altair for interactive data visualization and model performance insights.

# Technologies Used

Python: The core programming language.

pandas: For efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.

numpy: For numerical computations.

Altair: For creating interactive and declarative visualizations.

scikit-learn: For machine learning models and evaluation.
